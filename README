WWW-phpBB-Poster version 0.01
=============================

I wrote this module for own purposes - exactly for generating SEO-ready forums, already filled in with some parsed data.
Hope, it shall be useful for you :)

P.S. It handles only MySQL and SQLite phpBB installation.

P.P.S. It is NOT suggested for fork using - if so - you may got strange results with posts and topics.
If you want to use this module with forks - please, fix it manually for InnoDB using - commiting, etc.
